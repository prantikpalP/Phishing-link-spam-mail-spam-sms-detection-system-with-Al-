#INTRODUCTION
Online threats like phishing links, spam emails, and fake SMS messages are becoming more common. This project aims to create a simple web application that helps users check if a message or link is dangerous. The tool uses an AI model from GitHub to scan the input and label it as phishing, spam, or safe. The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it easy for users to interact with.
